There it is. 

My first finished artwork of 2023.

I like to listen to audiobooks before bed. I find that the narrator drowns out the inner narrator that I listen to constantly, and gives them (me) a break. Sometimes, I listen to fantasy novels and get cozy in a story while I drift off to sleep. Other times, I try to listen to uplifting books about creativity and whatever I'm working through personally at that moment.

One night while laying in bed (because it takes me 2-4 hours to fall asleep),  I was thinking about a capybara sketch I had made. Sometimes I work through things in my head, like sketching without a pencil - but I can see it in my mind... and I made myself frustrated. Without even being by or holding an art supply. Without the art even being in front of me and being messed up in the physical world!

Ridiculous.

So, I put on an audiobook. This one was Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert. I have had it downloaded on my app for years When I picked it up I wasn't ready for it and turned it off within the first couple of chapters.  

BUT NOW?

RESONATING.

I fell asleep, and woke up the next day with what I call a "download". 

"Don't overthink it" - a little voice said to me as I opened my eyes.

I immediately wrote it down, and as I was working on this little guy, kept it in mind.

Capy's are chill, and they always look like they are enjoying the moment, or contemplating the universe, but never overthinking ANYTHING.

This guy will always remind me to step back when I am being too critical, and not playing as an artist. To stop comparing. To be grateful.
