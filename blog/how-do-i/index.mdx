Hey! I’m glad you asked! I am really excited that you want to begin your journey into design and/or development. Every time I get the opportunity to add another creative to the world? It makes me feel warm and fuzzy.

## My Advice

My advice to those wanting to start out in graphic design and/or coding is this: We have all been at the beginning, and it’s going to seems a little overwhelming at first. But don’t quit! 

That means you are growing! 

(I still tell myself this as I am learning something new, or get stuck.)

## Practice makes... You better!

Also - Design and Coding are skills! No one is inherently a creative or programming genius. You have to practice a skill to get better at it, and that’s going to take some time. But every single minute you put into learning and practicing this stuff is going to pay off in the long run. I promise. 

The fact that you are excited and have passion for this already is proof!

## So, where do I start?

The best thing about graphic design and coding is that are TONS of ways you can learn them. 

### Check out some local classes!

Do you want to go to school? Check out your local community college - I loved my design classes because they were small, intimate, and I felt inspired being apart of a community of other people like me, learning the same things. I graduated in 2003, and I am still very good friends with many of my instructors and classmates!

### Check out some online classes!

You want to begin NOW? Great! You can teach yourself this stuff. Here are some places I use and recommend.
