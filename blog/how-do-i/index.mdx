### First, Some Advice from your friendly neighborhood unicorn

My advice to those wanting to start out in graphic design and/or coding is this: We have all been at the beginning, and it’s going to seems a little overwhelming at first. 

But don’t quit! 

It means you are growing! 

(I still tell myself this as I am learning something new, or get stuck.)

### Practice makes... You better!

Graphic Design and Coding are skills! 
No one is inherently a creative or programming genius. 
You have to practice a skill to get better at it, and that’s going to take some time.
But every single minute you put into learning and practicing this stuff is going to pay off in the long run. It will feel slow and tedious at times - But, then you will hit a sweet spot where its fun again, and boom - a hit of dopamine keeps you going!
