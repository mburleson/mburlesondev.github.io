## Summary
4Men had a unique vision for their website. I was brought on as a frontend developer to help bring the design to life. I was selected because of my experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and familiarity of PHP and WordPress themes.

### Needs
Working with the designer, we addressed their needs for customizations for WordPress which included an Instagram type experience, including a rating engine highlighting their photographic layouts and sharing function. OF course, they wanted this built in a way that they could just upload their content on their own, and work beautifully everytime.

### Responsibilities
I was brought on as a consultant. I was given the comps and specs to build the project from a WordPress starter theme. I used the Genesis/StudioPress framework, PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to complete this project.

### Solutions
* Rating System
* Carousel / Slider
* WordPress Theme Customizations
