# Our Knight Life

## Summary
When her blog started taking off in ways she never imagined, Emily and I worked together for her re-branding. She wanted a modern, updated design that showcased her new blog name, and made it easy for her subscribers to transition, and for new readers to experience her fantastic content. Together we designed a logo, graphic assets, and color pallet and pulled them together to create a fun and easy to read site.
