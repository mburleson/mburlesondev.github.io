<p>Back in July 2022, I suddenly got spooky month vibes. So, I of course, dug back into my childhood for some inspiration.
I am a Xennial. So, to me, McDonald's Happy Meal Buckets came to mind (and of course the McNugget guys)!</p>
<p>Recreating these guys in my style (of the moment) I decided to add a mcVampire bucket (didn't you think that was missing? Or is it a thing I am mis-remembering?)</p>

<h2>Spooky Buckets, The Game!</h2>
<section className={portfolioStyles.spookyGame}>
<p>I love combining art with code. So as a simple JavaScript exercise, I decided to make a Matching game featuring these Spooky Buckets! <br/><br/>
You can play it, <a href="https://mburleson.github.io/spooky-memory-game/" title="Spooky Memory Game!">here!</a></p>
